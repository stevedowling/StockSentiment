# X.com Stock Sentiment Analysis - Azure Function Project Plan

## Project Overview
An Azure Function-based system that monitors selected X.com (formerly Twitter) accounts, analyzes their posts for market sentiment using OpenAI, and provides insights about potential stock market impacts.

## Technical Stack
- Azure Functions (Timer-triggered and Durable Functions)
- X.com API v2
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Azure Key Vault (for secure credential storage)
- Azure Table Storage (for data persistence)
- Azure Virtual Network with Private Endpoints
- Azure DDoS Protection
- Application Insights
- Azure CDN
- C# (.NET 9.0)
- React (Web UI)
- Pulumi (Infrastructure as Code)
- SignalR Service
- Azure AD B2C

## Architecture
Following Clean Architecture principles with distinct layers:
1. Presentation Layer (API endpoints, React UI)
   - ASP.NET Core Web API with SignalR integration
   - React frontend with real-time updates
2. Application Layer (use cases, orchestration)
   - CQRS pattern for command/query separation
   - Durable Functions for complex workflows
3. Domain Layer (business logic, entities)
   - Rich domain models with validation
   - Domain events for state changes
4. Infrastructure Layer (external services, persistence)
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Azure managed identities for secure access

## Core Components

### 1. X.com Data Collector
- Timer-triggered Azure Function with async/await patterns
- Fetches posts from configured accounts using X.com API
- Stores raw posts in encrypted Azure Table Storage
- Implements rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns
- Configuration for account list management
- Proper exception handling with retries
- Comprehensive logging and telemetry

### 2. Sentiment Analyzer
- Durable Functions for orchestrating analysis workflow
- Processes new posts using OpenAI API with batching
- Extracts market-relevant information
- Generates sentiment scores and confidence levels
- Stores analysis results in Table Storage
- Caches frequently accessed predictions
- Tracks model drift and performance metrics

### 3. Alert System
- Event-triggered Azure Function
- Monitors sentiment changes above threshold
- Sends notifications via SignalR
- Generates summary reports
- Implements audit trails for all alerts
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

### 4. React Web UI
- Real-time sentiment dashboard using SignalR
- Push notifications with Azure SignalR Service
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Azure AD authentication with MSAL
- Mobile-responsive design
- CDN for static content delivery
